2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Bacterial Strains and Pellicle Formation
Three serovars of Salmonella consisting of three unique strains from the University of Arkansas Center for Food Safety Culture Collection were used in this study. This included three strains of S. Kentucky (UA CFS# 38-0055, 38-0084, 38-0085), three strains of S. Enteritidis (UA CFS# 38-0086, 38-0087, 38-0088), and three strains of S. Heidelberg (UA CFS# 38-00126, 38-00127, 38-00128). Quadrant streaks of the isolates from frozen stocks were prepared on Luria–Bertani (LB) (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) agar plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, single colonies were selected and grown in 5 mL of LB broth overnight in a 37 °C shaking incubator for 18 h. Overnight cultures of each of the Salmonella strains were diluted 1:10 and inoculated into 125 mL flasks containing 50 mL of LB broth without salt (10 g tryptone and 5 g yeast extract per L) (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Flasks were placed at room temperature for 96 h with the planktonic cultures developing pellicles by the end of this period. At the 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h time points, 1 mL of culture was collected directly below the meniscus and total RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). RNA was stored at −80 °C until qRT-PCR was performed. Two independent trials were performed for this study.
2.2. Quantitative Reverse-Transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) Assay
The qRT-PCR assays were performed using the Verso 1-Step RT-qPCR Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and optimized using an Eppendorf RealPlexTM Mastercycler Epigradient Thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). To remove any DNA remaining after RNA extraction, the RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) before each assay. Primer pairs for the csgD, bcsA, and the rRNA housekeeping gene rsmC were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) and confirmed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BLAST. Primer sets yielded amplicons that were 156, 136, and 190 bp for the putative bcsA, csgD, and rsmC genes. A mastermix was prepared to ensure that each 25 µL reaction contained the following: 12.5 µL of 2× 1-Step qPCR SYBR Mix (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 1.25 µL RT Enhancer, 0.25 µL Verso Enzyme mix, 500 nM of each forward and reverse primer, 100 ng of total RNA template, and nuclease-free water (MBI Growcells, Irving, CA, USA). The qRT-PCR conditions consisted of a 5-minute cDNA synthesis step 50 °C step followed by a 15 m Hot Start at 95 °C. Then, 40 cycles consisting of 15 s for denaturation at 95 °C, 15 s for primer annealing at 55 °C, and 20 s for amplicon extension at 68 °C was performed with melt curves. The melt curves were produced by cycling form of 95 °C for 15 s and then by 60 °C for 20 m with a 0.5 °C increase in temperature per minute until a final temperature of 95 °C was reached. Each assay was performed in triplicate.
2.3. Statistical Analysis
In order to study the differences in gene expression among the three Salmonella serovars, we observed the RNA transcript levels of the pellicle structural genes csgD and bcsA as determined by qRT-PCR. The CT value was taken from 40, which is the maximum number of cycles, to give the relative abundance of CT (nCT). Therefore, an increase in CT means there is an increase in gene expression, a decrease in CT means there is a decrease in gene expression. The differences in CT values were compared with values exhibited by the rRNA housekeeping gene rsmC and analyzed using the JMP® 14.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) software suite. Data were analyzed using n-way ANOVA. Means were separated using Tukey’s protected HSD with a significance level of p ≤ 0.05. The SEM, or standard error of measurement, was included as it represents the variation of the data across the average.
3. Results
3.1. CsgD Expression
First, the main effect of time was evaluated in order to determine if changes in gene expression were temporal. The temporal variation of csgD expression throughout the study was demonstrated, with the peak of gene expression at day 3. (p < 0.0001, Figure 1, Table 1). The main effect of serovar was significant, with S. Kentucky and Heidelberg exhibiting lower levels of gene expression than S. Enteritidis (p < 0.0001, Figure 2). The gene expression for day 4 was the most divergent (p < 0.05, Table 2).

In order to determine if the changes in gene expression between serovars were driven by specific strains, poultry isolates of Salmonella Heidelberg, (38-0055, 38-0084, 38-0085), Enteritidis (38-0086, 38-0087, 38-0088) and Kentucky (38-0126, 38-0127, 38-0128) over time were evaluated. The interaction between strain and serovar was statistically significant, with a demonstrated variation between strains within serovar (Table 2). Salmonella Kentucky 38-0085 showed the lowest level of gene expression on day 4 compared to 38-0055 and 38-0084 (Table 2). Two of the three strains increased their gene expression on day 1, with all strains decreasing gene expression relative to day 3 on day 4. Additionally, S. Kentucky strain 38-0084 exhibited a higher magnitude of gene expression changes throughout the study as compared to other strains (Table 2). S. Heidelberg expressed less variation, with day 2 relative to day 1 and day 4 relative to day 1 exhibiting the same direction of variation, though the magnitude was different. Finally, S. Enteritidis demonstrated the highest level of gene expression and the most dramatic variation in the interaction between strain and time (Table 2). Therefore, there are significant interactions in the differences in csgD expression between the serovars, as well as the strains independently, across time. Temporal expression of csgD was polynomial, with gene expression increasing from day 0 to day 1, dropping by day 3, and then increasing by day 4 (Figure 3).

3.2. BcsA Expression
In order to evaluate the differences in the overall gene expression across time irrespective of serovar, the main effect of time for bcsA expression was evaluated. The overall trend of the expression was statistically significant and was highly variable. Overall expression levels of bcsA showed polynomial trends in temporal expression, with gene expression increasing from day 0 to day 1, followed by a decrease on day 2 and day 3, and then increase again on day 4 (p < 0.0001, Table 3, Figure 4). The greatest difference in gene expression differences of bcsA was between day 0 and day 4, with a 2.89-fold change reduction in gene expression to day 0 (Table 2). When comparing the main effect of serovars, S. Enteritidis and S. Kentucky demonstrated the highest gene expression overall (p = 0.0019, Figure 5).

Table
The interaction between strain and time was also significant, though it was not as dynamic as the gene expression differences of csgD (p < 0.05, Table 4). S. Kentucky strain 38-0084 showed the greatest gene expression difference between day 2 and day 3 as compared to the other serovars (p = 0.0152, Figure 6c). Additionally, S. Kentucky strain 38-0085 demonstrating the lowest gene expression on day 4 as compared to the other strains (p = 0.0152, Figure 6c). Unlike the two other serovars, S. Enteritidis strains were more or less volatile in their expression as compared to the other serovars. There was some variation on gene expression on day 4, with strain 38-087 and 38-088 bcsA expression being the most divergent from 38-086 (p < 0.0001, Figure 6a). S. Heidelberg was slightly more dynamic than the other two serovars (p = 0.0222, Figure 6b). On day 1, 38-0127 and 38-1026 expressed more bcsA as compared to 38-1028 (Figure 6b). Strain 38-1026 had higher levels of gene expression as compared to the other strains on day 3 (Figure 6b). Finally, day 4 bcsA expression was the lowest in 38-0127. Therefore, while the strains were not as volatile in their gene expression of bcsA and csgD, differences between strain and serovar existed.

3.3. Ratio of csgD to bcsA Expression
In order to compare the differences in gene expression magnitude between csgD versus bcsA, the ratio of the nCTs were taken. It should be noted that an upregulation of csgD initiates the bcsA operon. If their ratio was similar across all serovars and time, then mechanistically it is theorized that the transcriptional mechanism guiding cellulose pellicle formation is conserved between serovars. Data indicate that there is significant variation in fold change csgD/bcsA between serovars, although there is no significant difference in the interaction between strain and time (Table 5, Figure 7). We theorize that the differences in gene expression between these two genes are temporally unique, and therefore, may be mechanistically different. A greater number of replications across numerous strains would likely prove that point.

Kentucky on day 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. 1 N = 270, n = 18, p =0.0065.

Table
Starting at day 0 Salmonella Heidelberg and Kentucky, csgD/bcsA fold change was greater than Enteritidis, meaning csgD expression was higher prior to pellicle formation. By day 1, the difference in the ratio of csgD/bcsA was not different between serovars. The ratio increases significantly by day 3 for Enteritidis and Heidelberg and decreases for Kentucky, meaning Kentucky expresses less csgD than the other two serovars. All serovars had similar ratios in their gene expression on day 4.
