# Listen, See, Act: Building Embodied Agents with Multimodal LLMs and 6-DOF Robotic Arms

## Abstract

This short communication introduces an innovative system integrating multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) with six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) robotic arms, enabling natural language-based robot control and environmental interaction. Our system implements a closed-loop perception-cognition-execution framework through speech recognition, visual understanding, and action execution modules, allowing robotic arms to comprehend and respond to complex natural language instructions. We compare traditional pre-programmed control methods with our LLM-based intelligent approach, demonstrating the latter's significant advantages in adaptability, flexibility, and user-friendliness. Through rigorous quantitative evaluation, we demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional methods, including an 89% instruction adaptability rate and 76% dynamic error correction success rate. This research provides new insights and practical pathways for AI applications in mechanical engineering and industrial automation domains, particularly for scenarios requiring rapid deployment and adaptation to changing environments.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional robotic arm control systems primarily rely on pre-programmed instruction sequences, which demonstrate high precision and reliability in structured environments but face two major limitations: (1) insufficient flexibility to adapt to dynamic environments and task requirements; and (2) high technical barriers requiring operators with programming skills and specialized knowledge. The advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has opened new possibilities for robotic arm control [1,2].

This research proposes an embodied intelligence system based on multimodal LLMs, constructing a "Listen, See, Act" perception-cognition-execution closed loop that enables robotic arms to understand natural language instructions, perceive environmental changes, and execute highly adaptive operations. Our system allows non-technical personnel to control complex robotic arm operations through simple voice commands, significantly lowering the barriers to robotics technology adoption.

## 2. Field Review and Technical Challenges

### 2.1 Current State of Robotic Manipulation

Robotic manipulation has evolved significantly over the past decade, transitioning from purely programmatic approaches to more flexible methods. According to a comprehensive review by Liu et al. [3], conventional approaches to robotic manipulation can be categorized into three paradigms:

1. **Rule-based systems**: Traditional industrial robots using pre-defined motion sequences and conditional logic
2. **Learning-based methods**: Systems using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, or other machine learning techniques
3. **Hybrid approaches**: Combinations of rules and learning that attempt to balance reliability with adaptability

Despite these advancements, industry adoption of flexible robotic systems remains limited. Surveys indicate that 78% of industrial robotic arms still operate under rigid programming paradigms, with an estimated 120 engineering hours required for each new deployment scenario [11]. This rigidity presents a significant barrier to implementing automation in small-batch, high-mix manufacturing environments that characterize modern production needs.

### 2.2 LLMs in Robotic Control: Recent Developments

Recent research has explored the integration of language models with robotic systems. Brohan et al. [4] demonstrated vision-language-action models capable of transferring web knowledge to robotic control tasks. Huang et al. [5] proposed an "inner monologue" approach for embodied reasoning using language models. Shah et al. [6] presented a framework for robots to request human assistance when encountering uncertain situations.

These efforts, while promising, face several crucial technical challenges:

1. **Real-time performance constraints**: Industrial applications typically require response times under 1 second, which many current LLM-based systems struggle to achieve
2. **Grounding gap**: Translating language understanding into precise spatial coordinates and physical actions
3. **Safety and reliability**: Ensuring consistent performance and preventing costly errors or safety incidents
4. **Resource efficiency**: Managing computational resources for on-site deployment without cloud dependencies

### 2.3 Technical Bottlenecks in Embodied AI Systems

Despite rapid progress in LLM capabilities, several bottlenecks hinder their effective integration into robotic systems:

1. **Multi-modal representation alignment**: Synchronizing information from visual, auditory, and proprioceptive inputs
2. **Motion planning with semantic understanding**: Converting high-level instructions into optimal joint trajectories
3. **Context maintenance across interactions**: Preserving state and adapting to environmental changes
4. **Hardware-software integration latency**: Minimizing delays between perception, decision, and action phases

Our research directly addresses these bottlenecks through novel system architecture and optimization techniques described in the following sections.

## 3. System Architecture

## 6. Quantitative Performance Verification

To rigorously evaluate our system against industrial standards and traditional approaches, we conducted extensive quantitative testing across multiple dimensions:

### 6.1 Instruction Understanding Accuracy

We tested the system with 100 random voice instructions varying in complexity and ambiguity (e.g., "move the green block to the right" without specifying exact coordinates). Key metrics:

- **Overall instruction interpretation rate**: 89% (compared to 0% for traditional pre-programmed systems)
- **Complex instruction understanding**: 82% success on multi-step instructions
- **Contextual understanding**: 78% success on instructions requiring previous interaction context
- **Error recovery through clarification**: System autonomously requested clarification in 94% of ambiguous cases

### 6.2 Visual Localization Precision

We evaluated the system's ability to precisely locate objects in dynamic environments:

- **Object detection accuracy**: 96% for standard geometric objects, 88% for irregular objects
- **Pixel-level precision**: Average error ≤4.2px in 1080p camera feed
- **Real-world positioning error**: <0.9mm at end effector (compared to industry standard of <1.0mm)
- **Environmental variation tolerance**: Maintained 91% accuracy under variable lighting conditions (200-800 lux)

### 6.3 Real-time Performance Indicators

We measured end-to-end system latency across different operational scenarios:

- **Voice input to motion initiation**: 763ms average (range: 612-925ms)
- **Visual processing latency**: 142ms average
- **Decision generation time**: 384ms average
- **Motion planning and execution**: 237ms average
- **Total cycle time**: 763ms, well within the industrial real-time requirement of <1000ms

### 6.4 Comparative Benchmark Study

We conducted a direct comparison between our LLM-based system and traditional pre-programmed approaches using standardized industrial benchmarking tasks:

| Metric | Our System | Traditional Method (Pre-programmed) | Improvement |
|--------|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| Instruction Adaptability | 89% | 0% (requires fixed instructions) | ∞ |
| New Task Deployment Time | 2 minutes | 2 hours | 98.3%↓ |
| Dynamic Scene Error Correction | 76% | N/A (no adaptive capability) | - |
| Task Completion Rate | 92% | 98% | 6.1%↓ |
| Energy Efficiency | 45W average | 38W average | 18.4%↑ |
| Initial Setup Cost (engineering time) | 0.5 hours | 8 hours | 93.8%↓ |

The results demonstrate that while traditional methods maintain marginally higher task completion rates in strictly controlled environments, our system offers dramatic improvements in adaptability, deployment efficiency, and ease of use. The slight decrease in task completion rate (6.1%) is offset by a 98.3% reduction in deployment time and the ability to handle dynamic environments.

## 7. Experiments and Results

We designed three experimental scenarios to evaluate system performance in practical applications:

### 7.1 Assembly Task Performance
The system was tasked with assembling a six-component mechanical device based solely on verbal instructions and visual feedback. Results showed 86% successful completion rate on first attempts and 94% after one clarification interaction, compared to traditional systems requiring explicit programming for each component placement.

### 7.2 Environmental Adaptation
Tests evaluated the system's ability to maintain performance when objects were randomly repositioned between operations. Our system maintained a 76% task completion rate with zero reprogramming, while traditional systems required complete recalibration and reprogramming (2+ hours of engineering time).

### 7.3 Non-expert Usability Evaluation
Ten participants with no robotics experience were given 15 minutes of orientation before attempting to program both systems for a pick-and-place task:
- Our system: 100% of participants successfully programmed the task in an average of 4.2 minutes
- Traditional system: 20% success rate with average programming time of 48 minutes

## 8. Conclusion and Future Work

This research demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of integrating multimodal LLMs with robotic arm control systems. Our approach significantly improves the flexibility, adaptability, and user-friendliness of robotic systems while maintaining acceptable performance metrics. The quantitative results validate that embodied AI systems have substantial potential in industrial applications, particularly in scenarios requiring frequent task switching and adaptation to changing environments.

Key limitations of our current implementation include slightly increased energy consumption, occasional clarification interactions that extend task completion time, and the need for stable network connectivity for optimal LLM performance. These limitations represent promising areas for future research.

Future work will focus on enhancing the system's spatial reasoning capabilities, improving real-time performance through model distillation techniques, and developing more sophisticated learning mechanisms that combine demonstration-based learning with reinforcement learning approaches. We also plan to extend this framework to multi-arm collaborative environments and more complex industrial tasks, particularly those involving flexible materials and precision assembly operations.
